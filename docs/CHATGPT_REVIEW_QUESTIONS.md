# ChatGPT Review Questions - Timestamp Accumulator Design

**Context:** We're building a real-time speech transcription system using WhisperLive. The current implementation uses text-based deduplication which is fragile when the model rewrites text. We want to switch to timestamp-based deduplication with a configurable "finalization fence" that separates immutable (locked) from mutable (unlocked) segments.

**Design Document:** See `TIMESTAMP_ACCUMULATOR_DESIGN.md`

## Questions for ChatGPT Validation

### 1. Architecture & Approach

**Q1.1:** Is using absolute timestamps as the primary key the right approach for handling WhisperLive's sliding window architecture?

**Context:** WhisperLive sends segments with:
- `start` and `end` timestamps (absolute, relative to recording start)
- Same text can appear with slightly different timestamps (±50-150ms jitter)
- Text can be completely rewritten when model changes its mind
- Segments are re-sent with `completed: true` when finalized

**Q1.2:** Should we use fuzzy timestamp matching (±100ms tolerance), or implement a more sophisticated alignment algorithm (e.g., DTW, forced alignment)?

**Q1.3:** Is the "finalization fence" concept (liveEdge - lockWindow) a sound way to manage immutability? Are there better patterns from streaming systems or CRDT research?

---

### 2. State Management

**Q2.1:** We maintain two caches (`lockedCache` and `unlockedCache`) that are invalidated on updates. Is this the right balance between performance and simplicity?

**Alternative approaches considered:**
- Red-black tree / interval tree for O(log n) queries
- Immutable data structures (persistent trees)
- Event sourcing with snapshot/replay

**Q2.2:** For long recording sessions (8+ hours), should we implement segment archival/pruning, or is storing all segments in memory acceptable?

**Memory estimate:**
- 1 hour recording ≈ 3600 segments
- 150 bytes per segment
- Total: ~540 KB/hour → 4.3 MB for 8 hours

**Q2.3:** Should we support state serialization for session recovery (e.g., browser crash, page reload)?

---

### 3. Edge Cases & Conflict Resolution

**Q3.1:** How should we handle overlapping segments with different timestamps?

**Example:**
```
Segment A: [2.0s ─────── 5.0s] "how are you"
Segment B:      [3.0s ────────── 6.0s] "are you doing"
```

**Current approach:** Keep both segments if timestamps don't match within tolerance

**Alternatives:**
- Merge overlapping segments and choose longest/most recent
- Reject overlaps entirely
- Use confidence scores (if available) to resolve conflicts

**Q3.2:** When a rewrite overlaps the finalization fence, should we:
- Reject the entire segment (current approach)
- Accept the unlocked portion and truncate
- Force-unlock the locked portion (dangerous!)

**Q3.3:** Should we implement a "grace period" where recently-locked segments can still be updated (e.g., 500ms grace window)?

---

### 4. API Design

**Q4.1:** Is the query API comprehensive enough for real-world use cases?

**Current API:**
```typescript
getLockedSegments(): Segment[]
getUnlockedSegments(): Segment[]
getAllSegments(): Segment[]
getSegmentsInRange(start: number, end: number): Segment[]
querySegments(query: SegmentQuery): Segment[]
```

**Missing features?**
- Word-level queries (if WhisperLive adds word timestamps)
- Confidence-based filtering
- Speaker diarization support
- Metadata/tags on segments

**Q4.2:** Should `setLockWindow()` allow negative values (lock future segments preemptively)?

**Q4.3:** Should we expose a `unlockSegmentsFrom(timestamp)` method for "undo" functionality?

---

### 5. Performance Optimization

**Q5.1:** Is caching the right optimization strategy, or should we use a different data structure?

**Benchmark scenarios:**
- 100 segments: O(n) filter = ~0.1ms (negligible)
- 10,000 segments: O(n) filter = ~10ms (noticeable)
- 100,000 segments: O(n) filter = ~100ms (problematic)

**Q5.2:** Should we implement incremental fence updates (only process segments between old and new fence) or full recomputation?

**Q5.3:** For range queries, should we sort segments on insert (O(n log n)) or on query (O(n log n))?

---

### 6. Configuration & Tuning

**Q6.1:** Is 2.0 seconds a reasonable default for `lockWindow`?

**Trade-offs:**
- Smaller window (0.5s): More aggressive locking → stable output, but less refinement
- Larger window (5.0s): More refinement → better accuracy, but unstable preview

**Q6.2:** Should `lockWindow` be adaptive based on:
- Speech rate (faster speakers → smaller window)
- Model confidence (low confidence → larger window)
- Audio quality (noisy → larger window)

**Q6.3:** Should we support multiple lock policies?
```typescript
enum LockPolicy {
  TIME_BASED,      // Current: fence = liveEdge - lockWindow
  COMPLETION_BASED, // Lock only on completed: true
  HYBRID,          // Lock on completion OR time-based
  MANUAL           // User controls via UI
}
```

---

### 7. Testing & Validation

**Q7.1:** What additional test cases should we add?

**Current coverage:**
- Basic insert/update/reject
- Duplicate detection
- Lock state transitions
- Timestamp jitter handling

**Missing scenarios:**
- Out-of-order segment arrival
- Concurrent WebSocket messages
- Extreme jitter (>200ms)
- Very short segments (<100ms)

**Q7.2:** Should we implement property-based testing (e.g., using fast-check) to verify invariants?

**Invariants to test:**
```
1. No two locked segments have overlapping timestamps (within tolerance)
2. segments.sort((a,b) => a.start - b.start) is always stable
3. finalizationFence <= liveEdge
4. All locked segments have end < finalizationFence
5. Version numbers are monotonically increasing
```

**Q7.3:** How should we validate against the old text-based implementation during migration?

---

### 8. User Experience

**Q8.1:** Should we show the finalization fence in the UI?

**Mockup:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ FINAL TRANSCRIPT                                 │
│ hello world how are you doing fine               │
│                                    ↑ fence (5.0s)│
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ LIVE PREVIEW                                     │
│ hello world how are you doing fine today         │
│                                    └─ mutable ───┘│
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Q8.2:** Should we provide visual feedback when segments transition from unlocked → locked?

**Q8.3:** Should users be able to manually lock/unlock individual segments (e.g., right-click → "Lock this segment")?

---

### 9. Future-Proofing

**Q9.1:** If WhisperLive adds word-level timestamps in the future, how should we integrate them?

**Possible structure:**
```typescript
interface WordSegment {
  word: string;
  start: number;
  end: number;
  confidence?: number;
}

interface Segment {
  start: number;
  end: number;
  text: string;
  words?: WordSegment[];  // Optional word-level breakdown
  locked: boolean;
}
```

**Q9.2:** Should we support streaming to multiple consumers (e.g., WebSocket broadcast to multiple clients viewing same session)?

**Q9.3:** Should we implement a plugin system for custom segment processors (e.g., profanity filter, entity extraction, summarization)?

---

### 10. Production Readiness

**Q10.1:** What monitoring/observability should we add?

**Metrics to track:**
- Segment ingestion rate (segments/sec)
- Lock transition rate (locks/sec)
- Duplicate rejection rate (%)
- Average segment duration
- Fence lag (liveEdge - finalizationFence)
- Cache hit rate

**Q10.2:** Should we implement rate limiting to prevent runaway segment creation (e.g., max 100 segments/sec)?

**Q10.3:** What error recovery strategies should we implement?

**Scenarios:**
- WebSocket reconnection (should we preserve state?)
- Corrupted timestamps (NaN, Infinity, negative)
- Extreme clock skew (segment arrives 1 hour in the future)

---

## Summary

**Key decision points:**
1. Timestamp matching tolerance (100ms vs adaptive)
2. Overlapping segment handling (keep both vs merge)
3. Fence overlap resolution (reject vs truncate)
4. Data structure choice (arrays + cache vs tree structures)
5. Lock window default and adaptivity
6. State persistence/recovery

**What we need ChatGPT to validate:**
- Is the overall architecture sound?
- Are we missing critical edge cases?
- Is the API design intuitive and complete?
- Are the performance characteristics acceptable?
- What's the best way to handle the open questions above?
