## üéØ Quick Reference: Key Decisions

### Design Choices Made

| Aspect | Choice | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Primary Key** | Timestamp (start, end) | More robust than text for rewrites |
| **Matching Tolerance** | ¬±100ms | Handles WhisperLive jitter |
| **Lock Window** | 2.0 seconds | Balance stability vs refinement |
| **Data Structure** | Array + cache | Simple, fast enough for typical sessions |
| **State Transitions** | Unlocked ‚Üí Locked | One-way for safety |
| **Overlap Handling** | Keep both if timestamps differ | Preserve information |

### Design Choices Pending (Need ChatGPT Input)

| Aspect | Options | Question |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Adaptive Fence** | Fixed vs dynamic | Should fence adjust based on speech rate? |
| **Overlapping Segments** | Keep, merge, or reject | Best UX for overlaps? |
| **Timestamp Tolerance** | Fixed vs adaptive | Should tolerance scale with duration? |
| **Long Sessions** | Keep all vs archive | When to prune old segments? |
| **Lock Policy** | Time-based vs completion-based | Support multiple policies? |

## üìä Design Metrics

### Complexity

| Metric | Current (v3.0.7) | Proposed (v4.0.0) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Lines of code | ~400 lines | ~300 lines (estimate) |
| Core algorithm | SPC + EW + BoF + Soft Tail | Timestamp matching + Fence |
| State tracking | 7 variables | 5 variables |
| Edge cases | 4 mechanisms | 2 mechanisms |

### Performance (1 hour session)

| Operation | v3.0.7 | v4.0.0 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Ingest segment | 0.08ms | 0.05ms |
| Get transcript | 0.02ms | 0.01ms (cached) |
| Memory usage | 600KB | 540KB |

### Robustness

| Scenario | v3.0.7 | v4.0.0 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Text rewrite | ‚ö†Ô∏è Fragile (LCP breaks) | ‚úÖ Robust |
| Timestamp jitter | ‚úÖ N/A (text-based) | ‚úÖ Handled (¬±100ms) |
| Duplicates | ‚úÖ Detected | ‚úÖ Detected |
| Out-of-order | ‚ö†Ô∏è May break | ‚úÖ Handled |

## üîç Critical Questions to Validate

Before implementing, get answers to these **5 critical questions**:

### 1. Timestamp Jitter Tolerance
**Q:** Is 100ms the right tolerance?
**Context:** WhisperLive sends timestamps with ¬±50-150ms jitter
**Options:**
- Fixed 100ms
- Adaptive based on segment duration (e.g., 5% of duration)
- Learn from data (track actual jitter distribution)

### 2. Overlapping Segments
**Q:** How to handle segments with different timestamps that overlap in time?
**Example:**
```
Segment A: [2.0s ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 5.0s] "how are you"
Segment B:      [3.0s ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 6.0s] "are you doing"
```
**Options:**
- Keep both (current design)
- Merge into one segment
- Reject based on confidence/length

### 3. Lock Window Default
**Q:** Is 2.0 seconds reasonable for `lockWindow`?
**Context:** Smaller = more stable, Larger = more refinement
**Options:**
- Fixed 2.0s
- Adaptive based on speech rate
- User-configurable with good default

### 4. Fence Boundary Conflicts
**Q:** What to do when rewrites overlap the finalization fence?
**Example:** Locked region ends at 5.0s, new segment is [4.5s - 7.0s]
**Options:**
- Reject entire segment (safe but may lose data)
- Accept unlocked portion only (complex)
- Force-unlock conflicting portion (dangerous)

### 5. Long Session Scaling
**Q:** For 8+ hour sessions, should we archive old segments?
**Context:** 8 hours = ~28,800 segments = ~4.3 MB
**Options:**
- Keep all in memory (simple, but grows unbounded)
- Archive to IndexedDB after 1 hour (complex, but scalable)
- Implement sliding window (keep last N segments)
